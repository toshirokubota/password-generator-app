### What I learned

Through online search and help with AI, I was able to find a way to customize a range input bar and its thumb. There is still a glitch, however; when the browser is refreshed, the value of the range is set back to the default of 9 while the thumb remains at the previous position. I tried to figure out how to move the thumb programmatically, but I was not able to...

I was able to control the checkboxes with keyboard. In one of previous projects, I could not toggle a radio box with keys, and now I realized that I was using 'name' attribute instead of the id for the label's 'for' attribute. This time, I could make it work.

### Continued development

I want to learn about web accessibility and implement the frontend to handle it properly.
